# Smsapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng run startDev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Backend is located at https://github.com/leojacob7/SMSAppBackend
For the backend to work we need to specify two env variables TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN in your .env file.

This is a simple app built with angular on the front end and rails on the backend. App can be accessed https://angularfe.herokuapp.com/login

The idea is to help a registered user send sms, and track the history here.
